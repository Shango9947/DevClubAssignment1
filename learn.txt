DevClub is a club of IITD which gives an initiative to the students mainly freshers to do well in Coding and Dovelopment
which are the most important thing which an engineer must be knowing. This Club provides the material to the students(best material)
by which a student can learn many things and hence become good in all these things..
I found the DevClub the best among all the TechClubs..
